Over the years I've developed a set of really scalable sass folders that
I use in most or all of the projects I've done.

It started being written in `.sass` but due to code politics at my job
I have to switch to `.scss` also since I now contribute to the
`Pixel2HTML` generator I haven't updated that much my `Ground-Zero`
package. But I always use my sass files since I consider them more usable
than the ones on the Boilerplate, and that way they can work in a more
plug and play situation.

## Instructions

```
$ npm install --global yo generator-odin-scss
$ yo odin-scss
```
